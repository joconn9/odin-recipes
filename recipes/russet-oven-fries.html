        <p>French Fries! Yum! I <strong>love</strong> french fries, but I am also 
        trying to watch what I eat. These fries allow me to indulge in one of my 
        favorite foods, without all the fat! Win/win! Pro tip: after the fries are 
        done cooking, throw them under the broiler for some extra crunch!</p>
